## Using

### Convert a number given from user

```bash
$ ./BigNumberBaseConverter 10 2 123456789
```

The above command will convert the number `123456789` from base `10` to base `2` and print the result.

### Convert a number from a file and save the result in another file

```bash
$ ./BigNumberBaseConverter -f input.txt 10 2 > result.txt
```

The above command will convert the number from the file `filename.txt` from base `10` to base `2` and print the result to the file `result.txt`.

### Convert a number from a file and print the result to the console

```bash
$ ./BigNumberBaseConverter -f input.txt 10 2
```

The above command will convert the number from the file `filename.txt` from base `10` to base `2` and print the result to the console.
